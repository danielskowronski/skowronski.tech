If you are getting **ADDriverStoreAccessNonLocalException** error when accessing Outlook.com (you may also have difficulties with syncing via ActiveSync/Exchange) you may need to log in using full version of Internet Explorer (mobile version or Edge might not be enough) and after a while you will be able to use it in other browsers. It's strange bug but I beleive it's caused by migration from old Outlook to OWA (Office 365 style webmail).
