22 lata temu Linus wypuÅ›ciÅ‚ pierwszÄ… wersjÄ™ systemu, ktÃ³ry zmieniÅ‚ Å›wiat - Linux 0.01

Wszystko zaczÄ™Å‚o siÄ™ od sÅ‚ynnego wpisu na grupie comp.os.minix z 26 sierpnia 1991:

> Hello everybody out there using minix -
> 
> **I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and  
> professional like gnu)** for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing  
> since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on  
> things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat  
> (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons)  
> among other things).
> 
> I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work.  
> This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and  
> I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions  
> are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them ðŸ™‚

> Linus (torv...@kruuna.helsinki.fi)
> 
> PS. Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.  
> It is NOT protable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never  
> will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.

Potem - 17 wrzeÅ›nia na FUNET (sieÄ‡ Å‚Ä…czÄ…cÄ… kraje skandynawskie) zostaÅ‚a wrzucona wersja 0.01. MoÅ¼na jÄ… wciÄ…Å¼ pobraÄ‡ z tÄ…d - [http://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/Historic/linux-0.01.tar.gz][1]

Dopiero 5 paÅºdziernika Linus uznaÅ‚, Å¼e wersja 0.02 siÄ™ do czegoÅ› nadaje. I napisaÅ‚ tak:

> Do you pine for the nice days of minix-1.1, **when men were men and wrote  
> their own device drivers?** Are you without a nice project and just dying  
> to cut your teeth on a OS you can try to modify for your needs? Are you  
> finding it frustrating when everything works on minix? No more all-  
> nighters to get a nifty program working? Then this post might be just  
> for you ðŸ™‚
> 
> As I mentioned a month(?) ago, I'm working on a free version of a  
> minix-lookalike for AT-386 computers. It has finally reached the stage  
> where it's even usable (though may not be depending on what you want),  
> and I am willing to put out the sources for wider distribution. It is  
> just version 0.02 (+1 (very small) patch already), but I've successfully  
> run bash/gcc/gnu-make/gnu-sed/compress etc under it.
> 
> Sources for this pet project of mine can be found at nic.funet.fi  
> (128.214.6.100) in the directory /pub/OS/Linux. The directory also  
> contains some README-file and a couple of binaries to work under linux  
> (bash, update and gcc, what more can you ask for :-). Full kernel  
> source is provided, as no minix code has been used. Library sources are  
> only partially free, so that cannot be distributed currently. The  
> system is able to compile "as-is" and has been known to work. Heh.  
> Sources to the binaries (bash and gcc) can be found at the same place in  
> /pub/gnu.
> 
> ALERT! WARNING! NOTE! These sources still need minix-386 to be compiled  
> (and gcc-1.40, possibly 1.37.1, haven't tested), and you need minix to  
> set it up if you want to run it, so it is not yet a standalone system  
> for those of you without minix. I'm working on it. You also need to be  
> something of a hacker to set it up (?), so for those hoping for an  
> alternative to minix-386, please ignore me. It is currently meant for  
> hackers interested in operating systems and 386's with access to minix.
> 
> The system needs an AT-compatible harddisk (IDE is fine) and EGA/VGA. If  
> you are still interested, please ftp the README/RELNOTES, and/or mail me  
> for additional info.
> 
> **I can (well, almost) hear you asking yourselves "why?". Hurd will be  
> out in a year (or two, or next month, who knows), and I've already got  
> minix. <u>This is a program for hackers by a hacker.</u> I've enjouyed doing  
> it, and somebody might enjoy looking at it and even modifying it for  
> their own needs.** It is still small enough to understand, use and  
> modify, and I'm looking forward to any comments you might have.

> I'm also interested in hearing from anybody who has written any of the  
> utilities/library functions for minix. If your efforts are freely
